# Jeenius
Every day we discuss and debate. Climate change. War. Politics. Religion. 
Health. And everything else under the sun. 

Your uncle tells you Covid was a hoax. Your co-worker says socialism sucks. 
Your sister tells you capitalism sucks. Your best friend supports Ukraine. Your 
piano teacher supports Russia. Did the US respond correctly to the Chinese 
spy balloons? Does Israel’s Supreme Court have too much power? And a 
million more questions.

Whatsapps, Facebook, Twitter – and every other platform – are filled with 
humans’ favourite past-time. Discussion. 

Yet too often these conversations get heated. Too often we stop talking. One 
thing is certain: all of us wish we knew more. Wish we had a better command
of the facts. Wish we could put our finger on exactly what we think and why.
